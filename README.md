## **Description**

For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I was given a design mockups using figma for a mobile and desktop layout. I had to match the designs perfectly, where I had to write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I had to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for desktop screens.
